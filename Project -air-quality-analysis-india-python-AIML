Project: Air Quality Analysis in India

Objective

This project analyzes air pollution levels in India using Python and the Pandas library. It focuses on pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, and NO₂ to understand air quality trends over time.

Workflow

Data Collection – A dataset containing air pollution data is used for analysis.

Data Cleaning – Missing values are removed, and the date format is corrected.

Data Analysis – Pollution levels are examined to find trends and patterns.

Data Visualization – Graphs are created to present the air quality data clearly.


Data Cleaning

Before analyzing the data, it is cleaned to remove any missing values and ensure the date column is in the correct format. This step is essential for accurate results.

Visualization

Line Chart: Used to show changes in pollution levels over multiple days. This helps in identifying trends, such as rising or falling air pollution levels.

Bar Chart: Compares pollution levels on different days, making it easy to see which pollutant had the highest concentration on each date.


Conclusion

The project helps in understanding air quality trends in India.

The visualizations provide insights into how pollution levels vary over time.

The dataset can be expanded to include more cities and longer time periods for better analysis.
